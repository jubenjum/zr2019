# 2 - beer : python 3

################## IF YOU WANT TO USE YOUR GPU FOR OSSIAN
# First intall nvidia-docker as explained in 
# https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/03/21/using-nvidia-gpu-within-docker-container.html
# 
# Then, you need to have a running CUDA and CUDNN library
# Be careful, theano looks in the wrong place for cudnn libraries and includes 
# You can do this to solve this issue:
#	cp usr/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
#	cp usr/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include/
# then run : python check_theano_gpu.py
# if the output is "used the gpu" then theano setup is completed.
# You can now change the GPU argument in baseline.sh to "use_gpu" in stage 4
# Note : BEER works only on CPU but can be paralleled on multiple CPUs.
